# New AFLNet version

This repo is a fork of the stateful Fuzzer [AFLNet](https://github.com/aflnet/aflnet), developed to cope efficiently with stateful systems.

# Upgrades

## Outputs a complete state model

This version of AFLNet allows the user to export the state model of the system by integrating the labels in the edges.

# Allows testing the fuzzer on custom code

AFLNet only supports known protocols. This version implements a **TEST** version that allows processing the *requests* and *responses* of custom software.

For example: 

    ./afl-fuzz -d -i ./input -o output -N tcp://127.0.0.1/port -P TEST -D 10000 -q 3 -s 3 -E -R ./my_program

allows to read from the input folder the messages to send to *my_program* and interprets the messages received from the program as *response codes*
